						<p>I have been the team leader for our website development team for the past four years. It is my job to design and build the back-end of this website in my favorite computer language, PHP. I also assign organize project collaboration by assigning tasks to other team members. This year I thought it would be interesting to develop a custom back-end framework instead of using an existing one. I have learned a lot from studying how other frameworks and software design patterns work.</p>

						<p>I am the head front-end developer for our TSA website and have yet only learned html and css this year.  My first year here in TSA has been a very fun and educational one, I've learned to code and how to use different front-end development frameworks, like twitter bootstrap, and am enjoying it a lot.  It as well helps that have I quite the eye for a clean design, so my job of making the templates is a fun one.</p>

						<p>I am the content developer for the design brief. It is my job to write and record HTML and CSS tutorials to teach younger students how to code. Because this is my first year coding, I have been able to teach from the perspective of a student. I know which concepts to put more emphasis on and how to approach them in a way that new coders can easliy learn.</p>

						<p>I am the lead content developer for both the main site and our design brief. Much of my work is done through the administration panel, where I edit various pages accross both websites. My biggest challenge this year was adding the written tutorials to each video in our design brief. The tutorials may have been simple, but there were many of them!</p>
